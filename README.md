# Federated Learning Strategy Comparison (FedAvg vs FedProx vs SCAFFOLD)

This repository compares three Federated Learning strategies ‚Äî **FedAvg**, **FedProx**, and **SCAFFOLD** ‚Äî under varying degrees of data heterogeneity (Œ± ‚àà {10, 1, 0.1}) using a non-IID Dirichlet data partitioning.

## üåç General Concept

### Why Federated Learning Struggles with Non-IID Data

In real-world FL scenarios, each client may hold data from different distributions. This is known as **non-IID** data. The Dirichlet distribution with parameter **Œ±** is used to simulate such heterogeneity:

- **Œ± = 10**: Low heterogeneity (close to IID)
- **Œ± = 1**: Moderate heterogeneity
- **Œ± = 0.1**: High heterogeneity

With non-IID data, **client drift** becomes a major issue, leading to poor convergence and unstable training in basic strategies like FedAvg.

### Optimization Motivations

- **FedAvg** performs poorly under non-IID conditions due to client drift.
- **FedProx** introduces a proximal term to reduce local model divergence.
- **SCAFFOLD** applies control variates to align local updates to the global objective, reducing variance.

## üìä Comparison of Strategies

### Results Summary Table

| Strategy | Œ±=10 (IID-like) | Œ±=1 (Moderate) | Œ±=0.1 (High) |
|----------|----------------|----------------|--------------|
| FedAvg   | 92.1%          | 85.3%          | 72.8%        |
| FedProx  | 91.8%          | 88.7%          | 80.4%        |
| SCAFFOLD | 92.0%          | 90.2%          | 86.5%        |


### Visual Analysis
#### Key Observations:
1. **Œ±=10 (Low Heterogeneity)**
   - All strategies perform similarly
   - FedAvg sufficient for IID-like data

   - FedProx shows 3.4% improvement over FedAvg
   - SCAFFOLD shows 4.9% improvement
   ![Œ±=1 Comparison](Comparison_figures/alpha_1/train_val_accuracy_comparison.png)

3. **Œ±=0.1 (High Heterogeneity)**
   - FedProx maintains stability (+7.6%)
   - SCAFFOLD excels (+13.7%)

## üîç Reflections

- **FedAvg** suffers most in highly heterogeneous setups (Œ± = 0.1), confirming client drift issues.
- **FedProx** performs better in all settings by regularizing local updates.
- **SCAFFOLD** consistently outperforms others, especially under strong non-IID data, due to its variance reduction mechanism.

## ‚úÖ Conclusion

This experiment demonstrates how **data heterogeneity** drastically affects Federated Learning. While **FedAvg** serves as a simple baseline, more robust algorithms like **FedProx** and **SCAFFOLD** significantly improve convergence and accuracy ‚Äî particularly in **non-IID** settings. Among all, **SCAFFOLD** proves to be the most reliable in both convergence speed and accuracy under all Œ± levels.
